Hello, thank you for your interest in Tunify, the music guessing game where you can discover new tunes and test your musical skills. We are happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy playing our game.

Don’t miss this chance to have fun and show off your music knowledge. Stay tuned and rock on! 🎸

## Design Process

Hi there, welcome to Tunify, the ultimate music guessing game where you can explore new songs and challenge your musical knowledge. We are Marvin (@s10260527) and Lucas (@LoocasToh), two web developers who love music and want to share our passion with you. We created this game to connect you with other music lovers and help you discover different cultures and traditions through music. Are you ready to have some fun? 🎵

Our website is very easy to use and navigate. Once you log in, you will see your points and your daily streak on the top of the page. You can use your points to redeem exclusive merch from our store, which is updated regularly with new items. Don’t miss this opportunity to get some cool stuff!

You can choose from two exciting game modes: “Guess The Song” and “Flappy Artists”. In “Guess The Song”, you will listen to a short clip of a song and try to guess its title and artist. You will get points for every correct answer and lose points for every wrong one. How many songs can you recognize? 🔎

**(Currently in development)**
In “Flappy Artists”, you will play a classic arcade game with a musical twist. You will control a bird that flies through pipes while listening to a song. After a while, you will have to guess the artist of the song before you can continue. How far can you go? 🐦

You can access both game modes from the homepage and start playing right away. You can also check the leaderboard to see how you rank among other players and compete for the top spot. Will you be the next music champ? 💪
